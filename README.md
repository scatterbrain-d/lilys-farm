# Lily's Farm

I designed this game for my two-year-old daughter. Colorful animals move across the screen and react when clicked or touched. 
Modular design allows easy addition and variation to featured animals. Background and animal design 
provided by my lovely and talented wife. Features include:
                    
- Responsive layout
- Vanilla JS
- Dynamic DOM element creation
- Animation with CSS
- Difficulty settings
